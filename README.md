# GTA IV SimpleGangWar script

Grand Theft Auto IV script to create a basic battle between two teams.

## Background

This is a port of [GTA V SimpleGangWar script](https://github.com/David-Lor/GTAV-SimpleGangWar) and [RDR2 SimpleGangWar script](https://github.com/David-Lor/RDR2-SimpleGangWar). Since most functions and methods are the same between GTA5, RDR2 and GTA4, and the language used is the same (C#), almost all functionalities were ported to GTA IV.
